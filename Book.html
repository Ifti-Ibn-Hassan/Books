            <h2>Black Hawk Down</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>The story of Black Hawk Down began when Delta Force arrested 20 </p>
            <p>Somalis. A Black Hawk helicopter was shot down and the rescuers</p>
            <p>were ambushed.Eighteen Americans were killed.The scene takes place</p>
            <p>in 1993 when the U.S. sent special forces into Somalia to destabilize</p>
            <p>the government and bring food and humanitarian aid to the starving</p>
            <p>population. Using Black Hawk helicopters to lower the soldiers onto</p>
            <p>the ground, an unexpected attack by Somalian forces brinds two of the</p>
            <p>helicopters down immediately. From there, U.S. soldiers must strug-</p>
            <p>gle to regain their balance while enduring heavy gunfire.</p>

            <p>Four Navy SEALs on a covert mission encounter goat harders who</p>
            <p>are likely connected to the Taliban.In homage to the men that were</p>
            <p>killed, Lone Survivor closely mirrors true story of Operation Red </p>
            <p>Wings, a tragic 2005 mission gone wrong in Afghanistan. Former </p>
            <p>Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell was the only survivor of a mission in</p>
            <p>Afghanistan in 2005, where along with three other SEALS he was </p>
            <p>tasked with killing a top Taliban commander. His story became</p>
            <p>the basis of his book, Lone Survivor, which has now been turned</p>
            <p>into a movie.
